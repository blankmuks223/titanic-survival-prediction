Features
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing unnecessary columns.

Feature Engineering: Adding Title, FamilySize, and AgeGroup.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Survival rate by gender, class, and other factors.

Modeling: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.

Visualization: Seaborn and Matplotlib plots showing trends and feature importances.
